Binomial coefficient 
Formula:
C(n,k) = C(n-1,k-1) + C(n-1,k)
1.	dynamic programming version-1:
   1.Involves two comparisons.
   2.	Creates 2-D array representation. 
   3.	Doesn’t computes the result which are already computed.
   4.	Efficiency is O(n*k)
   5.	The second for loop runs from j=0 to min (i,k) this is because in case where k is k+1, n will should return the value k only.
   6.	Doesn’t compute the entire 2-D.

2.	Recursive:
  1.	Each recursive call is going to create spaces for variables created during computation.
  2.	Computes the result which is already computed.
  3.	Efficiency is O(2n – 1) * 8 (bytes)
  4.	Computations are w.r.t the value of n.

3.	Dynamic programming version-2 (using 1-D array):
  1.	Usage of memset, flips the bits and sets the value 0 faster.
  2.	Second loop starts with min value and decrements in reverse order.
  3.	Display only the final array elements.
  4.	Values in the array grows as pascal triangle.
  5.	Efficiency is O(k).
